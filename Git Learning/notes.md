# Notes on git

- Version control manager.
- tracks changes in your code.
- git remote is your "github"
- local project is on your vs code 
- `git add .` 
    - adds everything in the current folder to staging area.
-Version Control System 
-Makes tracking changes to your code 
-Easily swap versions/undo changes. 
-Team needs a central place to save their changes: GitHub 
-Remote repository for other people to access their code. 
-Most likely, you won’t remember what you changed since an error occurred. 
-Git will show you what files have changed and what changed in each file. 
-Allows you to change back to previous versions of your code. 


-Initialize git into your project (git init) in the terminal 
-Adds .git folder to track all the changes you make to your project 
-Second option is to clone it. 
-git clone ssh_url 
-Adds .git folder 
-Adds Remote 


-Git Structure 
-Working directory 
-All the files in the local repository in their current state. 
-Add to index/staging, using the git add command 
-Tells git we want to track all the changes we have made in our working directory 
-Commit the changes to the head. 
-git commit 
-git push command 
-git remote add origin ssh_url 
-Push the changes to the remote repository on github 
-Pulling 
-Git pull 
 -Copies everything from the remote repository to your computer. 
-Branches 
-Copy of the code that has its own separate history 
-Pushing the changes to their own branch instead of to the master branch (so there’s no overlap in coding from feature a branch in feature b commit) 
-git checkout feature_b 
-git branch feature_b 
-git checkout -b feature_b 
-git merge feature_a 
-Will notify you of conflicts that occur with merging the branches. 
-git . add 
-Add every single file that is in our project. 
-Commit and then file will be added. 



-Git Tutorial for Beginners 

-Git vs Github
-Github = website. add-on/extension to Git. gives you commands
-Git = version control, (merging, pulling, pushing, making a commit)
-Repository: local/remote. A store: where you have a bunch of code. 
-Local: sits on your end, your version of the code 
-Remote repository: all of the updated code. Where you have the most recent version (where it works) 
-They push the changes from the local repository to the remote repository 
-Git figures out what happened in the two files that were changed and can merge those changes so that it will work
-Github tracks the history of commits 
-Commits are the changes that you made. 
-Storing when you changed a bunch of things and saved it as a bundle 
-Commit the changes locally. Can make multiple commits. Push them up to the remote repository. 
-Pull: pulling the changes from the remote repository, gives you all of the new commits since you last pulled those changes. 
-Merge them into the local repository
-Master branch
-The main branch of the repository. 
-One version of the code base. 
-Core code base.
-Want to make sure that it is always working 
-If other people pull from this, then their code will also be broken 
-Branch
-Copy of repository at a certain point in time that has different changes 
-Be able to work on a new feature, put it into a new repository without actually affecting the master branch. 
-Making different changes so that you’re not affecting the master branch because that’s what everyone else is using. 
-Can then merge it with the master branch once you’re sure that it’s working. 
-Takes all commit messages and merges them in the correct order that it should go to the master branch. 
-On the feature branch: you can still update the feature branch from the master branch. (so it can stay up to date but still -make changes without affecting the master branch) 

-cd: change directory 
-mkdir test_repo 
-Making a new folder on desktop 
-Make sure you’re in a git repository before doing all of the git commands 
-Staging area
-Where you temporarily add/remove files that you want to be in your next commit 
-git add (name of file) 
-git status 
-No commits yet, changes to be committed 
-commit when you’ve made some sort of progress
-git commit -m “commit message” 
-describes what you’ve changed in that commit 
-add file, stage, make another commit 
-git add . 
-add all files 
-git status 
-git commit -m “descriptive of commit” 
-make a new branch
-git checkout -b 
-change between branches
-b make a new branch 
-copied everything from the master branch, but everything you change on the new branch won’t affect the master branch. 
-git add . 
-git commit -m “first commit on new branch” 
-git checkout master 
-automatically removes the changes that were made on the other branch. 
-master branch has original changes 
-import pygame 
-git add . 
-git status 
-git commit -m “added test.py” 
-change to new branch 
-git checkout new 
-git merge master
-takes all changes from master branch and merges them with your changes 

-remote: url to another repository 
-git push -u origin master 
-push all commits to the origin master. 
-picking where and which branch you want to push to 
-u means save those settings 
-changes on the remote repository that you don’t have, so you need to pull those changes down before you can push them up to the remote repository 
-when you try to pull it down and there’s a conflict, you can’t automatically merge the code
-need to tell git what you want the code to look like. 
-delete all the arrows, make the file look how you want it to look 
-save it and resolve the merge conflict 
-commit the change 
-merge conflict: fix the file, add those changes, then commit those changes 
-git push: you can push up to the remote repository because you pulled, added, committed, and then you can push it.
